{"question": "How many Oscars did all the movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki combined win?", "results": "First, Hayao Miyazaki directed several animated films. Second, none of his films have won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature because this category started in 2002, and Miyazaki's earlier films were not retroactively awarded. However, Studio Ghibli films directed by Miyazaki have received other Oscar nominations and wins in different categories. Specifically, \"Spirited Away\" (2002) won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but it was not under Miyazaki's direction alone as it was a Studio Ghibli production. Considering the question strictly about his directorial works winning the Best Animated Feature Oscar, the answer is {0}.", "reasoning_chains": []}

The Nile runs through several countries including Egypt and Sudan, and there are numerous cities along its banks. However, the exact number of people living in these cities would require specific data from census or other demographic studies which isn't provided here. Therefore, without specific figures, we can't provide an exact number. But if we were to give a general idea based on major cities like Cairo (Egypt) and Khartoum (Sudan), the population could be in the tens of millions.
